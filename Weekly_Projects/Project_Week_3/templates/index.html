        <p>Most of the deaths in the world are mainly caused due to High Systolic blood pressure and least number of deaths are caused by discontinued breastfeeding.  </p>

        <img src="static/Number_of_deaths_of_each_factor.png" alt="">
        <p>The total number of deaths caused due to various factors in the entire world are increasing or decreasing from 1990 to 2017.	</p>
        <p> The number of deaths caused by Unsafe Water Source, Unsafe Sanitation, no access to handwashing facility, Household air pollution from solid fuels, Non-exclusive breastfeeding and Discontinued breastfeeding is been decreasing almost linearly from 1990 to 2017 due to many advancements in medical field. The number of deaths caused by Child wasting, Child Stunting and low birth for gestation is decreasing linearly from 1990 to 2017.  

            The number of deaths caused due to Secondhand Smoke is almost similar from 1990 to 2017.  
            
            The number of deaths caused due to Alcohol use and Drug usage is been increasing linearly. The number of deaths caused by diet low in fruits, diet low in vegetables, low physical activity, High fasting plasma glucose and high total cholesterol is been increasing linearly from 1990 to 2017.  

            The number of deaths caused by Unsafe sex has increased from 1990 to 2005 and from 2005 it has been decreasing.  The number of deaths caused by high body mass index, high systolic blood pressure, smoking and low bone mineral density is been increasing from 1990 to 2017.  

            The number of deaths caused by Iron deficiency; Vitamin A deficiency is been decreasing from 1990 to 2017.  The number of deaths caused due to Air Pollution is almost similar from 1990 to 2017 as the number of people and as well as the pollution is increasing in the same frequency.  

            The number of deaths caused due to Outdoor air pollution, Diet high in sodium, Diet low in whole grains and diet low in nuts and seeds is been increasing linearly from 1990 to 2017. </p>

            <p>Dependent variable: High systolic blood pressure 

                Independent variable: Low physical Activity 
                
                Linear Regression technique is used to find out how high systolic blood pressure depends on high body mass index. The deaths due to high systolic blood pressure have not increased exponentially with the increase of deaths due to high body mass index as the data is very close to the regression line.  
                
                The regression coefficient obtained is 1.34 which is close to 1 implies that deaths due to high systolic blood pressure can be predicted using deaths due to high body mass index.  </p>
